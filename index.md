I am a research scientist at DeepMind working on machine learning and computer vision. 

Before joining DeepMind, I completed my PhD at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2016, advised by [Yair Weiss](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yweiss/), studying generative models for low-level vision problems.

<!-- My current research deals with various problems in visual scene understanding, and generative approaches to solve them. I am also interested in approximate inference methods in probabilistic models. -->

I am interested in computational models of vision and 3D scene understanding, and using generative approaches that model vision as an inverse problem. 
- learning models of 3D scenes that can be used for inference.
- learning discrete representations that divide scenes into objects, types, and concepts.
- embodied generative models that can control key variables in the data they are trained to capture.
- scientific imageing, where knowledge of the image acquisition process is used to infer the underlying 3D scene.

I co-organised a workshop at NeurIPS 2019 titled "**Perception as Generative Reasoning: Structure, Causality, Probability**".  
See the [website](https://pgr-workshop.github.io) for all papers, invited talks and videos.

**Learning inverse graphics** - In the inverse graphics aproach vision problems are formulated as inference using a forward model that captures the image generation process. I am currently exploring different setups for learning forward models that can be used for efficient inference.
