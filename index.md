I am a research scientist at DeepMind working on machine learning and computer vision. Prior to that, I completed my PhD at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2016, advised by [Yair Weiss](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yweiss/), studying generative models for low-level vision problems.

My current research deals with various problems in visual scene understanding, and generative approaches to solve them. I am also interested in approximate inference methods in probabilistic models.
